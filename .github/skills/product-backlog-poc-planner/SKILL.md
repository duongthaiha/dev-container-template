# Product Backlog POC Planner

Use this skill to turn a fuzzy idea into a backlog an engineering team can actually build.

The mental model: **the backlog is the boarding pass, not the vacation brochure.** It must tell the team what to build, why it matters, what constraints shape the route, and what proof will count as arrival.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks for any of these outcomes:

- Convert an idea into product requirements, user stories, epics, or a POC backlog.
- Prepare an engineering team to build a prototype, pilot, MVP, or proof of concept.
- Clarify requirements before architecture or implementation starts.
- Include Azure delivery requirements such as Bicep, Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), private endpoints, private database networking, managed identity, and Key Vault.

## Prerequisites

- No MCP server is required.
- If the output makes Azure-specific claims, verify the relevant service behavior against official Microsoft documentation before finalizing.
- If the target database or hosting service is unknown, do not assume one. Ask or mark it as an architecture decision.

## Workflow

### 1. Frame the Idea Before the Architecture

Start with the Decision Framework sequence:

1. **Outcome** - What business or user result should change?
2. **Behavior** - What will the user or agent do differently?
3. **Platform** - What technology is needed only after the first two are clear?

If the user only gives a technology request, pull them back to the problem. Do not let "we need an agent" become the requirement.

### 2. Ask the Smallest Useful Clarifying Set

If requirements are incomplete, ask 3-5 high-leverage questions before creating the backlog. Prioritize:

1. Target users and workflow.
2. Success criteria for the POC.
3. Data sources and sensitivity.
4. Required actions or integrations.
5. Deployment, security, networking, and compliance constraints.

Use the [Intake Question Bank](references/INTAKE_QUESTION_BANK.md) when the idea is especially vague.

### 3. Capture Non-Negotiable Engineering Guardrails

Unless the user explicitly changes these constraints, include them as backlog requirements:

- Infrastructure is authored in **Bicep**.
- Deployment is supported through **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** with `azure.yaml` and an `infra/` folder.
- Database access is private by design: private endpoint, private DNS, app-to-database private connectivity, and public network access disabled where the selected database service supports it.
- APIs are **contract-first**: the system may contain multiple APIs/services, and **each one has its own explicit, versioned contract** (e.g. OpenAPI/Swagger for REST, schema for GraphQL/gRPC). Each contract is the shared source of truth between that API and its consumers (a frontend, another service, or an external client).
- Each API exposes a **mock implementation** of its own contract, so any consumer can be built, tested, and demoed independently of the real API and of the other services.
- Every consumer can switch between the **mock and the true implementation per API** via configuration (e.g. an environment variable or build flag) without code changes, so a service can run, for example, against a real upstream API while a still-unbuilt downstream API is mocked.
- Implementation produces genuine behavior: no hardcoded outputs, stubbed responses, or special-casing of known test inputs solely to pass tests or acceptance criteria. The per-API mocks are the single allowed exception, and each must serve contract-valid, varied data behind an explicit toggle — never silent hardcoding in production paths. If real behavior is out of POC scope, capture it as a decision or deferred story instead of faking results.
- Secrets belong in Key Vault or managed platform configuration; do not put secrets in backlog examples, source code, or `azd` environment files.

Use [Azure POC Guardrails](references/AZURE_POC_GUARDRAILS.md) and [Private Networking Checklist](references/PRIVATE_NETWORKING_CHECKLIST.md) for detailed acceptance criteria.

### 4. Generate Architecture Diagram

Before producing the backlog, create a Mermaid diagram of the proposed system architecture. The diagram should show:

- Key Azure services and their relationships.
- Data flows between components.
- Network boundaries (VNet, subnets, private endpoints).
- User entry points and external integrations.

Present the diagram to the user and **wait for explicit confirmation** that it matches their vision before proceeding. If the user requests changes, revise the diagram and confirm again. Do not move to backlog generation until the architecture is agreed.

### 5. Produce a Buildable Backlog

Structure the backlog as:

1. Product discovery and scope.
2. Azure infrastructure and deployment.
3. Private networking and security.
4. API contracts and mocks (one contract + mock per API/service).
5. Data and integration.
6. User experience and workflow (consumers wired to mock or true APIs).
7. Application/API implementation.
8. Observability and validation.
9. Deployment and success criteria verification.
10. Documentation of architecture decisions, workflow diagrams, and operational runbooks.
11. POC demo script and guide.


Use the [Backlog Output Template](references/BACKLOG_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md). Every story should have clear acceptance criteria and a visible owner type: Product, Engineering, Architecture, Security, Data, or DevOps.

### 6. Separate Decisions from Work

If a requirement is unresolved, create a decision item instead of hiding the ambiguity inside a story. Examples:

- "Select database service for POC workload."
- "Confirm whether private connectivity must support local developer machines, CI runners, or only deployed Azure services."
- "Confirm whether public ingress is allowed for the app tier or only private access is allowed end-to-end."

### 7. Keep the POC Honest

POC does not mean toy. It means **thin slice with production-shaped bones**. Keep scope small, but include the security and deployment skeleton early so the team does not build a demo that cannot survive enterprise policy.

## Output Format

Default output:

1. **Assumptions** - Explicit assumptions used to create the backlog.
2. **Clarifying Questions** - Only if blockers remain.
3. **POC Goal** - One paragraph.
4. **Architecture Diagram** - Mermaid diagram confirmed by the user.
5. **Backlog** - Epics and stories with acceptance criteria.
6. **Architecture Decisions** - Open choices and recommended default.
7. **Azure Guardrails** - Bicep, `azd`, private endpoint, identity, secrets, and observability requirements.
8. **Definition of Done** - What proves the POC is complete.

If the user asks for a shorter answer, provide only the backlog table plus the open questions.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Likely Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| User provides only a product idea | Missing outcome, users, and success criteria | Ask the smallest useful clarifying set before writing stories |
| User demands stories immediately | Planning pressure | Produce a backlog with an **Assumptions** section and mark unresolved items as decision stories |
| Azure service is unspecified | Database or host not selected | Add an architecture decision and keep private networking acceptance criteria service-neutral |
| Public database access appears in the idea | Enterprise policy conflict | Add private endpoint, private DNS, app connectivity, and public access disablement stories |
| Requirements are too broad for a POC | Scope creep | Define a thin end-to-end slice and move nonessential work to "Deferred after POC" |
| Stories or tests could be satisfied by hardcoding | Test-passing shortcut risk | Require genuine behavior; write acceptance criteria against varied/unseen inputs so hardcoded outputs fail, and mark any unavoidable stub explicitly |

## Post-Run Reflection

After completing a backlog, silently check whether the skill missed any repeatable pattern:

1. Did the user have to ask for a missing section?
2. Did an Azure networking or deployment constraint arrive late?
3. Were acceptance criteria too vague for engineering execution?
4. Did a new reusable question or checklist item emerge?
5. Generate architecture diagram and confirmed with the user that it matches their vision?


If yes, suggest a targeted update to this skill or one of its references.
